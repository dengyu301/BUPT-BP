//-------------------------------Question 1 #206 Reverse Linked List ---------------------------------//

Iterative solution(fast and less cost):

The idea for this problem is quite intuitive: To reverse the linked list, I only need to change every node's next pointer to its previous one.
Since singly-linked list only has one pointer points to the next node, I will lose the link to the rest of the list while I am changing a node's next
pointer. To handle this problem ,at least two additional pointers:
ListNode *sentinel = NULL; ----------- Represents the previous node of one node;
ListNode *next = NULL;     ----------- A node's next node;
are needed.

For every node(represented by ListNode *opt) in the linked list, the operation is as follows:
1) Assign next pointer to the node's next node: next = opt->next;
2) Change the node's next pointer to sentinel: opt->next = sentinel;
3) Change sentinel pointer to point at the current node which is the beginning of the new linked list.

The code is follows:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head) return NULL;
        ListNode *next = NULL;
        ListNode *sentinel = NULL;
        ListNode *opt = head;
        while(opt){
            next = opt->next;
            opt->next = sentinel;
            sentinel = opt;
            opt = next;
        }
        return sentinel;
    }
};


Recursive solution:

The idea of the recursive solution is to reverse every node behind after the given node, then add the given node to the end of the already-reversed-list,

The code is follows:

ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !(head -> next)) return head;
        ListNode* node = reverseList(head -> next);
        head -> next -> next = head;
        head -> next = NULL;
        return node; 
    }
    
(I didn't work out this problem using recursion, the answer is just a rewritten of other's code in discuss section)
However, intuitively I think recursion consumes a large chunk of space in the stack, so I don't think it is the optimal solution for this problem.
What do you think?
