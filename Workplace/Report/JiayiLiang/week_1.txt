//-------------------------------Question 1 #206 Reverse Linked List ---------------------------------//

Iterative solution(fast and less cost):

The idea for this problem is quite intuitive: To reverse the linked list, I only need to change every node's next pointer to its previous one.
Since singly-linked list only has one pointer points to the next node, I will lose the link to the rest of the list while I am changing a node's next
pointer. To handle this problem ,at least two additional pointers:
ListNode *sentinel = NULL; ----------- Represents the previous node of one node;
ListNode *next = NULL;     ----------- A node's next node;
are needed.

For every node(represented by ListNode *opt) in the linked list, the operation is as follows:
1) Assign next pointer to the node's next node: next = opt->next;
2) Change the node's next pointer to sentinel: opt->next = sentinel;
3) Change sentinel pointer to point at the current node which is the beginning of the new linked list.

The code is follows:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head) return NULL;
        ListNode *next = NULL;
        ListNode *sentinel = NULL;
        ListNode *opt = head;
        while(opt){
            next = opt->next;
            opt->next = sentinel;
            sentinel = opt;
            opt = next;
        }
        return sentinel;
    }
};


Recursive solution:

The idea of the recursive solution is to reverse every node behind after the given node, then add the given node to the end of the already-reversed-list,

The code is follows:

ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !(head -> next)) return head;
        ListNode* node = reverseList(head -> next);
        head -> next -> next = head;
        head -> next = NULL;
        return node; 
    }
    
(I didn't work out this problem using recursion, the answer is just a rewritten of other's code in discuss section)
However, intuitively I think recursion consumes a large chunk of space in the stack, so I don't think it is the optimal solution for this problem.
What do you think?





//-------------------------------Question 2 #19 Remove Nth Node From End of List ---------------------------------//

This problem is similar to the problem in Cracking the Coding Interview 2.2.

Algorithm:

1) Create two pointers, index1, pointing to the beginning of the node and pre, whose next
   is the head.
2) Increment index1 by n positions, to make it point to the nth node from the beginning.
3) Check for index1 != NULL if no increment index and pre, if yes, pre is the (n + 1)th node
   to the end.
4) Remove nth node from the end by using pre->next = pre->next->next;

The code is follows:
   
ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    ListNode *index1 = head;
    ListNode *pre = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode *res = pre;
    pre->next = head;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(index1 == NULL) return NULL;
        index1 = index1->next;
    }
    while(index1){
        index1 = index1->next;
        pre = pre->next;
    }
    pre->next = pre->next->next;
    return res->next;
}





//-------------------------------Question 3 #203 Remove Linked List Elements ---------------------------------//

My idea was simple at first:

1) create two pointers, ListNode *todelete = head; and ListNode *predelete = new ListNode(0);
        predelete->next = head;
2) Go through the list, if todelete->val == val, delete the node todelete.
Here is my code:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeElements(ListNode* head, int val) {
        if(!head) return NULL;
        ListNode *todelete = head;
        ListNode *predelete = new ListNode(0);
        predelete->next = head;
        ListNode *res = predelete;
        while(todelete){
            if(todelete->val == val){
                predelete->next = predelete->next->next;
                todelete = predelete->next;
            }else{
            if(todelete) todelete = todelete->next;
            predelete = predelete->next;
            }
        }
        return res->next;
    }
};


Then I saw a more concise solution to the problem in discuss section, which is so impressive,
I have pasted it here:

    ListNode* removeElements(ListNode* head, int val) {
        if(!head) return NULL;
        head->next = removeElements(head->next, val);
        return head->val == val ? head->next : head;
    }
    
My concern is when I am solving the problem, I can only come up with the simple, iterative answer,
never will I try to think about using recursion. So I think I need to do more work and figure 
out the connection between recursion and iteration.




//-------------------------------Question 4 #83 Remove Duplicates from Sorted List ---------------------------------//

The idea is using two pointers, one represents the unique value, the other is used to check if there are duplicates.

The code is follows:

    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head) return NULL;
        ListNode *org = head;
        ListNode *dup = head->next;
        while(dup){
            if(dup->val == org->val){
                dup = dup->next;
                org->next = dup;
            }else{
                dup = dup->next;
                org = org->next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
    
    
    
//-------------------------------Question 5 #21 Merge Two Sorted Lists ---------------------------------//

The idea is like merge two piles of sorted cards, we compare the top card of each pile, we take whichever is smaller and 
insert it to the bottom of the new pile.

My iterative solution is follows:


ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        if(l1 == NULL && l2 == NULL){
            return NULL;
        }
        if(l1 == NULL) return l2;
        if(l2 == NULL) return l1;
        struct ListNode *t1 = l1;
        struct ListNode *t2 = l2;
        struct ListNode *result = NULL;
        if (t1->val < t2->val) {
            result = t1;
        }else{
            result = t2;
        }
        struct ListNode *newNode = new struct ListNode(0);
        while(t1 != NULL || t2 != NULL){
            if(t1 == NULL){
                newNode->next = t2;
                t2 = t2->next;
                newNode = newNode->next;  
            }else if(t2 == NULL){
                newNode->next = t1;
                t1 = t1->next;
                newNode = newNode->next;                
            }else if(t1->val < t2->val){
                newNode->next = t1;
                t1 = t1->next;
                newNode = newNode->next;
            }else/* if(t1->val >= t2->val)*/{
                newNode->next = t2;
                t2 = t2->next;
                newNode = newNode->next;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    
My code is ugly and long, because I have checked too many redundant conditions, My thought 
was linear so my code deals with the situations at the beginning, and as I am going through
the list, I add additional conditions to tackle the new problems, however, I lack the ability 
to look at this problem in a larger scale, when I look back, most of the conditions can be 
combined together. Following is an example of a more concise solution:

    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* n1, ListNode* n2){
        if(!n1) return n2;
        if(!n2) return n1;
        if(n1->val <= n2->val){
            n1->next = mergeLists(n1->next, n2);
            return n1;
        }
        if(n1->val > n2->val){
            n2->next = mergeLists(n1, n2->next);
            return n2;
        }


After comparing these two solutions, here is what is my conclusion:

Most of the linked list questions can be solved by both iterative and recursive ways, 
and recursion can always lead to a concise code.



  
//-------------------------------Question 6 #160 Intersection of Two Linked Lists ---------------------------------//  

Well, there is a really tricky solution to the problem.

The essence of this problem is the sum of the length of two branches plus the length of the stem(我这里也不知道用stem对不对...但是不知道别的更好地表示方法，求指教。。)
is a constant, so any node that goes through the whole list will definitely end up meeting at the intersection.

The code is follows:

    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        if(!headA || !headB) return NULL;
        ListNode *pa = headA, *pb = headB;
        while(pa && pb && pa != pb){
            pa = pa->next;
            pb = pb->next;
            if(pa == pb) return pa;
            if(!pa) pa = headB;
            if(!pb) pb = headA;
        }
        return pa;
    }

For this kind of tricky problems, we'd better remember their solutions. 
    
//-------------------------------Question 7 #2 Add Two Numbers ---------------------------------//

This problem is the same as Cracking the Coding Interview 2.4.

This is a straightforward problem, just pay attention to the end of the list, if the carry is
1, we need to add an additional node the storage it.

ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode *startNode = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode *start = startNode;
        int addon = 0;
        while(l1 || l2 || addon){
            ListNode *newNode = new ListNode(0);
            startNode->next = newNode;
            startNode = startNode->next;
            int sum = (l1 ? l1->val : 0) + (l2 ? l2->val : 0) + addon;
            addon = sum / 10;
            startNode->val = sum % 10;
            l1 = l1 ? l1->next : NULL;
            l2 = l2 ? l2->next : NULL;
        }
        return start->next;
    }
    
    
//-------------------------------Question 8 #24 Swap Nodes in Pairs ---------------------------------//

My idea is simple:
